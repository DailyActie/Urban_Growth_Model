# Urban_Growth_Model
This is a Netlogo model and a partial reimplementation of the Urban Growth Model that was developed by Clarke, Hoppen and Gaydos. The study area is the City of Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA.

The urban growth dynamic implemented in the Urban Growth Model (UGM) contains four types of growth, namely:
(i) Spontaneous Growth - defines the occurrence of random urbanization of land.
(ii) New Spreading Centers - determines whether any of the new, spontaneously urbanized cells will become new urban spreading centers.
(iii) Edge Growth - defines the part of the growth that stems from existing spreading centers.
(iv) Road-Influenced Growth - agents take a road trip along a transportation infrastructure and look for suitable space for urbanization.
